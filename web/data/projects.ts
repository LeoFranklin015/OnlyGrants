        '**We are seeking funding to further develop and implement advanced governance tools rooted in the innovative mathematical concept of Neutrosophy within the Web3 community**. \n\nOur primary goal is to address the issue of unwarranted polarization in decision-making processes and promote a more empathetic, transparent, and constructive governance model. Through research, development, testing, and community engagement, we aim to integrate Neutrosophy into decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and collaborative initiatives, fostering better decision-making and enhancing the overall governance experience.\n\n## Introduction:\nWe are excited to introduce our project aimed at revolutionizing governance practices in the Web3 community. Traditional DAO governance often employs polarizing voting mechanisms, resulting in oversimplified binary choices that fail to capture the complexity of real-world decisions. Neutrosophy, a groundbreaking mathematical framework, offers a solution by accommodating nuanced opinions and uncertainties, facilitating more comprehensive decision-making.\n\n## Problem Statement:\nCurrent governance methods inherited by DAOs, influenced by binary mathematical logics, contribute to divisive decision-making processes. This binary approach oversimplifies choices and fails to represent the diverse range of opinions and uncertainties that real-world issues entail.\n\nIn real life, people face situations where the available information is insufficient and cause indecision, making it hard to vote “For”, or “Against”. In other situations, people can simultaneously partially agree, disagree and be undecided regarding a proposal. These situations are not contemplated with polarizing voting mechanisms. Consequently, a more advanced mathematical logic is needed to address these limitations and promote a more inclusive and empathetic governance model.\n# Introducing Neutrosophy\n \nNeutrosophy explicitly and intentionally allows us to deal with the mentioned situations among others with solid theoretical foundations and methods. With the support of Prof. [Florentin Smarandache](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmrQsSwAAAAJ) (Neutrosophy’s creator), we will be exploring different neutrosophic methods to apply in DAOs governance.\n\n## What We Have Achieved So Far:\nIn our journey towards implementing Neutrosophy-based governance, we have accomplished significant milestones:\n\n### CODE\nWe published [**NeutrosophyLib**](https://github.com/SatisfiedVagabonds/NeutrosophyLib), a Solidity library containing basic neutrosophic operations.\n\n![screenshot neutrosophylib](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F3N1oSUXwAIOiKY?format=png "screenshot neutrosophylib")\n\n> You can explore here [NeutrosohpyLib Basic Operations](https://github.com/SatisfiedVagabonds/NeutrosophyLib/blob/master/NeutrosophyLib_basic_operations_v1.pdf)\n\n### ARTICLES\nAfter months of research, we published **two articles** on Medium:\n\n> **June 2023:** [“How can the math of ‘I don’t know if…’ help improve the Democratic Deliberative Process?”](https://medium.com/@ranulfo17/how-can-the-math-of-i-dont-know-if-help-improve-the-democratic-deliberative-process-d59d0bef0945)\n>\n>From the article: _“However, it is important to acknowledge that the Democratic Deliberative Process is not without its challenges. One aspect that often goes unnoticed is the mathematical limitations inherent in traditional deliberative processes. Our decision-making processes in politics, business, and even on a personal level are heavily influenced by Boolean mathematics, which revolves around binary choices of “Yes” and “No” or opposing poles. While this simplification can be helpful, it also leads to a loss of valuable information and the inability to express opinions as a nuanced spectrum. Boolean mathematics forces us to choose a single option, even when our stance on complex issues may not align entirely with either extreme of “Yes” or “No.”_\n\n> **July 2023:** [“Neutrosophy as a tool to navigate a hybrid convex-concave world”](https://medium.com/@ranulfo17/neutrosophy-as-a-tool-to-navigate-a-hybrid-convex-concave-world-50a3f1c9b3ff)\n>\n>From the article: _“The purpose of this text is to introduce Neutrosophy as a tool to help us navigate a hybrid multidimensional convex-concave world. By navigating we mean making better decisions and/or expressing our opinions in the complex, messy contexts that sometimes we face. It also briefly introduces NeutrosophyLib, a Solidity library containing basic neutrosophic operations for those interested in exploring these ideas.”_\n\n\n### EVENTS\nWe presented our ideas during the Cripto Cantina ReFi event in San José, Costa Rica, and received positive feedback.\n\nRanulfo presented **“Neutrosophy for the Empathetic Governance in DAOs and Collaborative Businesses”** to a group of +20 blockchain entrepreneurs, developers, researchers, and enthusiasts.\n\n## Project Solution:\nOur project seeks to leverage Neutrosophy as a tool to enhance governance within DAOs and collaborative initiatives. Neutrosophy\'s ability to address complex decision scenarios, partial agreements, and uncertainties aligns perfectly with the multifaceted nature of decentralized communities. With the guidance of Prof. [Florentin Smarandache](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmrQsSwAAAAJ), the creator of Neutrosophy, we will explore and implement various neutrosophic methods to improve decision-making processes.\n\n## Project Objectives:\nOur key objectives for this project include:\n\n1. **Selection of Optimal Neutrosophic Method:** Identify and adapt a suitable neutrosophic method to support decentralized governance, starting with a voting proposal.\n2. **Testing and Feedback:** Test the chosen method in collaboration with Web3 initiatives such as [Cofiblocks.com](https://www.cofiblocks.com/), [Refi Costa Rica](https://linktr.ee/reficostarica), and [Diamante Bridge Collective](https://www.diamantebridge.org), gathering valuable feedback.\n3. **Community Engagement:** Present Neutrosophy\'s potential for governance improvement through virtual and/or in-person sessions across Costa Rica, Argentina, and Brazil, receiving input from the Ethereum and EVM community.\n4. **Development of NeutrosophyLib:** Enhance the Solidity NeutrosophyLib with additional functionalities and improvements based on practical application.\n5. **Knowledge Dissemination:** Publish three blog posts and at least one scientific paper detailing our experiences and findings. Participate in relevant podcasts to share insights.\n\n\n## Team:\n[Satisfied Vagabonds](https://linktr.ee/satisfiedvagabonds) has supported the development of governance and financial resilience tools for communities and Collaborative Businesses like Cambiatus, Sistema Natus and CofiBlocks since 2018. Our team for this project consists of dedicated individuals with a proven track record in mathematics, governance and financial resilience tools development:\n\n- Ranulfo Paiva Sobrinho [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranulfosobrinho/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ranulfovm)\n- Karla Córdoba Brenes [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muguika/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/muguika)\n- Florentin Smarandache (Advisor) [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tmrQsSwAAAAJ)\n\n## Budget:\nWe are seeking a grant of 30,000 USD to cover the following activities over the next three months:\n\n1. Research and Development: 30%\n2. Testing and Feedback Collection: 15%\n3. Community Engagement and Presentations: 20%\n4. NeutrosophyLib Enhancement: 10%\n5. Knowledge Dissemination (Blogs, Papers, Podcasts): 20%\n6. Event Participation: 5%\n\n## Thank you for reading until here!\nWe invite you to support our vision of creating a more empathetic and inclusive governance model within the Web3 community. By contributing to our Gitcoin campaign, you will help us achieve our objectives, implement Neutrosophy in DAOs, and foster a collaborative decision-making environment. Join us in building a future where polarization is reduced, collaboration thrives, and decision-making becomes a true representation of diverse perspectives.\n\n> What Patrick Collins (Ethereum top dev) commented on our work: *“Very cool!!! This is EXACTLY the type of experiments we need to run”.*\n\n\n![screenshot patrickalphac comment](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F3N1znjXgAAZhU3?format=png "screenshot patrickalphac comment")\n\n\n**Thank you for considering our proposal. Your support will drive the advancement of empathetic governance practices powered by Neutrosophy.**\n',

        "Ethereum Guatemala is a community formed by different members of the web3 ecosystem in the country that intends to collaborate and push its growth through different initiatives. Within Ethereum Guatemala there are projects such as: research with the Ethereum Foundation to bring access to credit in a decentralized way, digital art projects or NFTs that have been recognized globally, DeFi projects, research and use of blockchain in biology, among others. We believe that show-casing ENS will be an incredible example to demonstrate the power of the decentralized movements and the opportunities that exist for the ecosystem throughout Guatemala and countries like ours.\n\n![1](https://ethereumgt.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3d10e485-59be-4911-8cba-71744d30afae%2FScreenshot_2023-03-15_at_19.51.41.png?id=047bf622-8823-4bb5-b267-7f44a529d9a3&table=block&spaceId=f9df7a88-b1c5-4a47-b73a-99723748db28&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nTo date, we've hosted Guatemala's first (and now second) Ethereum conference: Eth Guate and Eth Ati. We had over 100 attendees join us for the event, ranging from builders, policy makers, entrepreneurs and investors in the ecosystem. The Universidad del Valle’s Centre for Innovation and Technology was an exceptional space to host our gathering, for which we are deeply grateful for their support in making this event possible!\n\nYou can see a recap of our event here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvhFBby4UtQ\n\nWe hosted 6 developer focused workshops ranging from an introduction to solidity through to the introduction to the recently-launched Filecoin Virtual Machine. We had over 10 different talks where we touched on the foundations of Ethereum, the interface of smart contracts with the legal systems, and the importance of public goods in the region - among a number of other diverse topics. \n\n![2](https://ethereumgt.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fef381358-16b7-4b55-86eb-f0a98af6076f%2FScreenshot_2023-03-15_at_19.55.22.png?id=8f775c5d-f297-4237-8336-a76671e32e6a&table=block&spaceId=f9df7a88-b1c5-4a47-b73a-99723748db28&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nOur international attendees joined us from El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, Argentina, Croatia, and Ecuador! 14% of the attendees who joined us for the event were women, and our core team is also all-male, for which a key focus for us moving forward is to both conduct more outreach to women-led technology and blockchain groups, as well as incorporate more female leadership in our core team!\n\n![3](https://ethereumgt.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9e05523b-26a0-446a-95f6-199455d5bdc2%2FScreenshot_2023-03-15_at_19.55.50.png?id=efa9d080-eb91-4be1-9226-8522806a15cc&table=block&spaceId=f9df7a88-b1c5-4a47-b73a-99723748db28&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\nIn total, we allocated 10 scholarships for attendees of the event, with whom we provided stipends between Q1,000-Q200 ($128-$25) to cover the cost of transportation and lodging for the event. These scholarships were awarded for both people coming from the rural areas of Guatemala as well as for some international guests.\n\nAny questions about Ethereum Guatemala, you can join the telegram (https://t.me/ethereumgt) and also find the relevant links in our linktree (https://linktr.ee/ethereumgt) :-)",

        "Mission-Oriented: Improving the Web3 Ecosystem\nIn our endeavor to enhance the Web3 ecosystem, we are dedicated to both onboarding and supporting mass adoption. We achieve this by collaborating with local and international artists to produce immersive arts experiences. Our focus is on educating and empowering disenfranchised communities with the resources necessary to participate and benefit from Web3.\n\nMinimum Age\nEndeavors Oakland, conceived in 2020 during the pandemic, has a track record of providing financial relief to under-resourced communities by supporting them with access to space and full production support. In 2021, we achieved a milestone by producing the first immersive NFT Art exhibition at the historic Tribune Tower in downtown Oakland. This exhibition featured murals by eight artists, digitally rendered by DIY J, and minted as an NFT collection on Makersplace.\n\nCommunity Growth Initiatives\nOur commitment to onboarding and mass adoption extends to forging partnerships with diverse community members, including artists, cultural producers, vendors, and small businesses. By bridging connections between real estate developers and communities, we aim to create mutually beneficial ecosystems that sustain both under-resourced communities and developers seeking to activate business in available Bay Area spaces.\n\nEducational Material & Resources\nEach project integrates an educational component, recognizing the power of art experiences in fostering education. We ensure accessibility in resources and connect networks to newcomers in the Web3 space. Our dedication extends to a youth education residency in partnership with local organizations and NFT marketplaces.\n\nInvestigative Journalism\nCollaborating with data collecting agencies, we will launch data-driven dynamic NFTs in collaboration with local artists, with a focus on using data related to racial justice to help inform our projects over time.\n\nContent Creation\nOur communication efforts include newsletters and blogs directing communities to Web3 resources, as well as encouraging projects that we can support with Web3 integrations.\n\nCommunity-Building DAOs\nWe are establishing a DAO governed by Endeavors token holders, contributing to ongoing operations and allowing stakeholders to vote on future project artist collaborations.\n\nUser Onboarding\nPrioritizing diverse community onboarding, we leverage our Web3 networks, including OAK Currency, an organization “building a community currency for a thriving Oakland.” We center and collaborate with local artists to educate and support individuals throughout the onboarding and growth process.\n\nInclusion, Diversity, and Advocacy Programs\nOur organization is dedicated to centering individuals historically marginalized and excluded from opportunities in technological and economic advancement. Comprising a team of BIPOC cultural producers, educators, and artists, we intimately understand and have been directly impacted by oppressive systems. Situated in one of the nation's most diverse regions, with a legacy of social movement building, we operate within and carry the energy of the birthplace of the Black Panther Party. Recognizing that investing in Black, Indigenous and People of Color communities is a crucial step toward dismantling colonial oppression, we prioritize amplifying their voices. Through these efforts, we aim to foster healing within our communities, creating an environment that is authentically inclusive and empowers everyone with the resources essential to thrive. \n\nABOUT US\nWith a history spanning over a decade, our team has experience in producing award-winning cultural and educational programming with institutions including SFMOMA and SFJAZZ. Additionally, we take pride in our role as creators of award-winning art spaces, including 7th West, Good Mother Gallery, and Agency Oakland. Our collective work is deeply rooted in the ethos of amplifying and empowering disenfranchised communities. Through immersive events and productions, we have successfully onboarded local creatives, leveraging our expertise to bridge the gap between diverse groups and the evolving Web3 landscape.\n\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\nWe are powered by dynamic Transient Labs NFTs, holding assets related to IRL events and educational workshops. NFTs contribute to operational sustainability and provide stakeholders with voting rights on future Endeavors collaborations.\n\nSODIUM Exhibition with Artist Ruff Draft\nBorn from the synergy of artist Brandon Ruffin aka Ruff Draft and Endeavors founder Assan Jethmal, this immersive journey challenges us to question the status quo and celebrate the diversity within our communities. The exhibition, located at The Loom in Oakland CA, includes a 1/1 Doppelgänger Transient Labs minted NFT with select images, stories, and POAPs to access IRL events.\n\nThe Oakland Roots Soccer Teams Web3 Integration\nCollaborating with The Oakland Roots, we are launching an NFT project amplifying their mission. Transient Labs minted NFTs may include POAPs to games, merchandise, and other unique benefits. \n\nGood Mother Ultrasounds\nSupporting mothers by matching artists with expecting and new mothers, this project provides financial relief through exhibitions and educational experiences in partnership with Good Mother Studio in Oakland.\n\nBlack Terminus | AR Design\nLaunching an NFT book and exhibition with artist Damien McDuffie.\n\nOakland Murals Token\nUsing the Transient Labs Doppelgänger contract, we will mint murals throughout Oakland with AR activations. Additionally, we are launching a nationwide mural tracking project, inscribing stories related to each mural’s message.\n\nOur projects aim to empower communities, bridge gaps, and bring Web3 to the forefront of inclusive and diverse experiences. Together, we amplify Oakland's creative power with Web3.\n",

        "We are an independently organized community that uses regeneration to foster community projects and the restructuring of social tissue in Costa de Oro, Aragua, Venezuela. Initially onboarded and supported by Web3beach, we have slowly scaled our initiatives driving environmental and educational impact for our participants and younger generations.\nThrough this project we have collected more than 300 tons of trash and organic wastes from the coastal zone of our municipality and jointing streets, this has helped drive tourist activities, rebuild social tissue and generate a communitary ecosystem in which local businesses start accepting crypto payments and participants have had the opportunity to learn about regenerative values while receiving small rewards for their participation in the waste recollection activities, fostering the growth of local economies.\nWe have also created and hosted an educational project that currently serves 20 kids and teenagers ranging from 5 to 13 years old, with art and environmental consciousness activities as well as tutoring in traditional subjects like math and sciences. The school provides the beneficiaries with 2 warm meals per day, providing a safe net to prevent malnutrition.\n",

        '# Team\nThis project is to be developed by the same team that developed the Abakhus dApp.\n# Project description\nWe started to develop Abakhus dApp (a privacy-preserving tokenization platform) early 2022 and deployed to mainnet in November 2023. An API to access Abakhus was developed then we decided to launch a Blockchain Innovation Hub (https://github.com/iberoam/blockchain-innovation-hub) and Hacker House (https://github.com/iberoam/hacker-house) to promote the development of additional projects and dApps using Abakhus API. This proposal is to develop a library named AbakhusJS as part of the Abakhus protocol. AbakhusJS is a TypeScript library of the Abakhus protocol, designed to interact with any blockchain network by utilizing design pattern concepts such as Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Singleton, Composite, and Observer. This approach provides a versatile, maintainable, and scalable architecture.\n\n# Achievements related to Abakhus dApp\n\n(i) Q1 2023: we partnered with IberoAm community and successfully organized a disrupting IRL event to onboard scientists, data privacy advocates and social impact leaders on the blockchain ecosystem called "From Genomes and Privacy to Social Impact using Blockchain" funded by Eth-Colombia and Clr.fund. The whole event was recorded and is publicly available (to serve as an educational resource) at the Technological Park of the Rio de Janeiro Federal University youtube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/FxnJ-pJgRsU?feature=share\n(ii) Q3 2023: Mid-September 2023 we presented a talk about Abakhus (privacy-preserving) dApp at the Blockchain Rio Festival:\nhttps://twitter.com/SecretNetwork/status/1702412567673442759\n(iii) Q4 2023: Early October 2023 we presented a talk about our privacy-preserving Abakhus dApp at the Rio Innovation Week:\nhttps://twitter.com/abakhus/status/1704981536070635629\n(iv) Q4 2023: Late October we presented a talk about “Blockchain and Privacy” for the students of the Rio de Janeiro Rural Federal University:\nhttps://twitter.com/amrdavila/status/1718047590388777159/\n(v) Q1 2024: We officially launched our Blockchain Innovation Hub on March 19th, during the DeSci Rio 2024 edition:\nhttps://twitter.com/abakhus/status/1763547619454837040\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176551950182670336\n\nThe creation of the Blockchain Innovation Hub was driven by the need to promote networking and partnerships among academia, private sector and government, aiming to develop new projects and dApps in the blockchain space. Our Hub offers a Hacker House, Courses on Blockchain in the Federal Universities of Rio de Janeiro and Blockchain-related events/conferences. The tokenization platform to be used for Cohort 1 of the Hacker House is our Abakhus dApp, meaning selected proposals will be mentored (Ideation and Prototyping) using the Abakhus dApp API. The development of a AbakhusJS library to interact with several blockchain networks is really needed not only for the Hacker House cohorts but for anyone to access that, test and enter the blockchain space.\n\n# AbakhusJS Requisites:\nAbstract Factory: Create an abstraction layer to produce different types of blockchain network clients, each specific to a particular blockchain protocol or network.\nFactory Method: Implement factory methods within the Abstract Factory to instantiate specific client implementations based on the target blockchain network.\nSingleton: Ensure a single instance of each blockchain client exists, preserving resources and ensuring consistent state throughout the application.\nComposite: Use the Composite pattern to represent and manage complex blockchain objects such as smart contracts and accounts, allowing for hierarchical organization and easier interaction.\nObserver: Employ the Observer pattern to enable event-driven communication and notification for blockchain events (e.g., transaction confirmation, new block) and allow components to subscribe and respond accordingly.\nType Safety: Utilize TypeScript\'s strong type system to define interfaces and types for blockchain clients, smart contracts, and other components.\nError Handling: Implement robust error handling strategies for blockchain interactions, including retries and fallback mechanisms.\nSecurity: Integrate secure practices such as input validation, sanitization, and private key management.\nDocumentation: Provide comprehensive documentation and clear references for users of AbakhusJS.\n\n# AbakhusJS Roadmap:\n(Q2 2024) Planning and Design: Define library objectives, use cases, and key abstractions. Design the architecture incorporating the required design patterns.\n(Q2-Q3 2024) Development: Implement the Abstract Factory for creating blockchain clients. Develop Factory Methods for different network clients. Implement Singleton for client instances. Use Composite for complex blockchain objects. Integrate Observer for event handling and notifications. Define TypeScript interfaces and types for clarity and safety.\n(Q3 2024) Testing and Optimization: Conduct unit and integration tests for each component. Optimize performance and memory usage.\n(Q2-Q4 2024) Documentation: Create thorough documentation including code examples, usage guidelines, and API references.\n(Q3-Q4 2024) Release and Maintenance: Release the library with versioning and changelogs. Monitor user feedback and make continuous improvements. Maintain compatibility with new blockchain protocols and updates.\n\nBy developing AbakhusJS we will abstract most of the blockchain interaction layer, including smart-contracts deployment for web2 developers then we will onboard them into web3 without the need for them to learn Solidity or Rust. This will have a double impact: (i) facilitating web3 education for web2 developers, and (ii) a more user-friendly way to develop new web3 applications\n\n# AbakhusJS repository\nhttps://github.com/Abakhus/AbakhusJS',

        "[Metagov](https://metagov.org) is a nonprofit laboratory for digital governance. Our mission is to cultivate tools, practices, and communities that enable self-governance in the digital age. We do this by building standards, APIs, governance data sets, research, and seminars to improve the governance of online communities.\n\nSome of our recent work include: \n\n## Grants Innovation Lab (GIL)\n\nGIL helps improve the understanding and tooling related to grant issuance to make it as easy as possible for those applying for grants while maximizing the impact of the work done. The project focuses on: \n- research on grant tooling, grantee assessment frameworks, Grant Maturity Index, and best practices; \n- technical development of Grant Management standards, shared databases of approved grants, common app for grants, and infrastructure for impact measurement; \n- Community, including spaces for grant program operators, technical working groups, and a mix of virtual and in-person events. \n\nWe recently hosted our second quarterly call for grant operators and are currently running a Twitter space series on the Future of Public Goods Funding featuring projects such as OS Observer, Karma GAP, Hats Protocol, Hypercerts, Drips, Metrics Garden, and EAS. At ETHDenver, we hosted the first Web3 Grant Summit, you can read more about the takeaways from the workshop [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JFjHL6VM5XMNEkmjUSfn4x2BitF1tnXfD3bvb3uBFGo/edit).\n\n## Public AI\n\n[Public AI](https://publicai.network) ensures that AI capacity:\n- delivering benefits to all, \n- reflects society’s values, and\n- is not limited to Big Tech. \n\nPublic AI has been hosting a weekly seminar series throughout the year and is in conversations with multiple governments around the world. We also recently hosted a 4 week seminar series with RAI on AI governance in January.\n\n## Other projects\n\n- Attestation Standard for DAOs: The Attestation Standard for DAOs (aka DAOIP-3) defines a basic indexing architecture on top of the verifiable credentials specification, in order to bootstrap a permissionless attestation system for DAOs. The standard has been utilized to deploy a public registry of DAO-related EAS schemas (DAOIP-7, upcoming) and will greatly improve the discoverability and interoperability of all kinds of DAO-related attestations.  \n\n- PolicyKit (https://policykit.org/): an engine for building governance in online communities. PolicyKit is being developed between the University of Washington and Metagov, and is being utilized in multiple communities, including Metagov as the mechanism through which the community proposes and votes on new seminars.\n\n- DAO Science (https://daoscience.org/): DAO Science is a nonprofit project to catalyze impactful work on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and other digitally-constituted organizations. In our paper, “Open Problems in DAOs”, we describe how researchers can contribute to the emerging science of DAOs and other digitally-constituted organizations. From granular privacy primitives to mechanism designs to model laws, we identify high-impact problems in the DAO ecosystem where existing gaps might be tackled.\n\n- Interoperable Deliberative Tools: With support from a grant from the Mina Foundation, Metagov is launching a new RFP focused on supporting more interoperability for deliberative decision making tools. Applications for this RFP are currently open through early May. Feel free to join our Slack and ask questions in the #interoperability channel. You can learn more about the RFP, including the full RFP and scope for the interoparbility [here](https://metagov.github.io/interop/).\n\n- Governance Research Round: As part of GG19, we hosted the first Governance Research Round where we were able to support 34 researchers with a matching pool of $25k thanks to support from the MetagovDAO and Arbitrum.  \n\nFor a full list of our contributions, please visit [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F425sIKhQZ3h_NsYLnXkfezmnn1UeZNqL4ORM6RRFgQ/edit?usp=sharing).",

        "![Paddy Field](https://i.postimg.cc/xqD401Gw/atarya-5-manypeople.png)\n\nRice is the staple food for billions of people around the world. Global rice production is estimated to be around 500 million metric tons annually. Rice / paddy cultivation is a water-intensive process, particularly when grown in flooded paddies, which is the case for much of the world's rice production. It's estimated that rice cultivation accounts for approximately 30% of global freshwater use in agriculture. \n\n> To produce 1 kg of rice, 5000 Liters of Water is required.\n\nThe water used for irrigation, along with the methane emissions from flooded rice paddies, significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Additionally, the production of rice requires significant amounts of other resources such as land, fertilizers, and pesticides, which can have detrimental effects on soil health, biodiversity, and water quality if not managed sustainably.\n\nAt present, there's a growing concern about the impact of chemical-intensive farming on our environment and rice paddies. Therefore, Atarya Agro is committed to adopting practical regenerative practices tailored to rice cultivation, aimed at restoring our ecosystem and promoting sustainable agriculture.\n",

Of course, further clinical research would need to be conducted to provide conclusive results.\n\nTo provide some context Acetylcholine (ACh) is synthesized in the brain when humans participate in altruistic events. Whereas Dopamine (DA) is synthesized when a human has a sense of accomplishment, er go learning.\n\nThis effect through the combined accumulation, in time could prove to be very beneficial to the individuals, with regard to the obvious impact it would have on societies, social engagement, and environmental ecosystems.\n\n\n---\n\n**Plan of action**\n\nPrior to considering further fundraising efforts, we have expanded our blockchain footprint, to be more inclusive of where communities we want to connect with are building.\n\nWe have presence on the following:\n\n* Ethereum Mainnet\n* Polygon\n* Arbitrum One\n* Optimism\n* Base\n* ZkSync\n* Lukso\n\nThis value add will provide pathways of entry into our KFMEDIA℠ Learning Center powered by CharmVerse and verified through Ethereum Attestations (EAS). Subsequently based on user course completion, token distribution, and EAS written on chain, this has mechanized the necessary tooling to provide meaningful impact reporting.\n\n\n---\n\n**Forward Looking Focus**\n\n100% of contributions will further enhance our treasury surrounding this program as we continue to identify more impact tokens to provide us with an asymmetrical approach for categories that align with the core curriculum. \n\nOur main deployer wallet is used only for the following purposes:\n\n1. Deploy smart contracts on chain\n2. Deploy rewards and EAS on chain\n\nAs we continue to curate and create more educational content focused on emerging technology and life skills, so too will our expansion of token allocation grow.\n\nWe are positioning ourselves by Q1 2025 to be a fully open community with composable tooling, and scalability to leverage the incoming impact of adopters to the blockchain ecosystem for their initial experience with a positive impact.\n",

Example brands would be Starbucks, Nike, Gucci, and Porsche to name a few. \n\nThe output from this research would be in the form of an interactive report published on jumpnation.xyz.\n\nThe goal is to help educate marketers and drive the adoption of web3 among leading brands. \n\nA core team would develop a short list of brands for the community to vote on. From there, a community driven research initiative would kick off to conduct research and create the output. \n\nThe report would be published on jumpnation.xyz and made available to anyone as a public good. We would also celebrate each report with a commemorative NFT and free mint. \n\nThree reports would be created in total. \n\nThe funding of this grant supports:\n- Collaboration within a community that has proven its staying power. \n- Content that educates marketers at leading brands and agencies\n- Helps drive adoption of web3 among enterprise brands\n\nRequested funding: $30,000 USDC. This funding would provide resources for:\n- On-chain analytics, data app, and UI that would be made available for the end user to interact with\n- Insights and editorial management to add context to each report\n- Creative development for each reports generative NFT\n- Marketing and promotion for each report\n- Community and project management \n\nThe interactive nature of these reports go much further than a simple white paper and will provide a rich learning experience worth sharing and talking about!

        "Layers is a series of 1 on 1 interviews, hosted by Fuckers team member Grilled Onion, with the intention to give listeners an hour of uninterrupted time to learn more about people they see in and around the Sei ecosystem.\n\nThus far, using spaces alone, Layers has highlighted several types of guests. Whether a valuable member of the Sei community, a founder launching a new projects, or a subject matter expert to learn more about web3, everyone has a background and story to tell and we want to learn about it. \n\nTo date, educational guests have included Whammer from Silo who taught us about Decentralized Finance, Tellus from Dragonswap who continued that conversation and let us know what was in store for the future of Dragonswap, and Sas, a team member of Bozo Hybrids to teach us more about hybrid tokens. \n\nHighlighting community members working to make Sei an always better place has also been a main focus for Layers. The entire Fuckers team, Arson of Seindicate, Shisho of Seipex, Wigs of $gonad and guest artist of several projects, Ruben of Sei the Whale, Roy Lopez founder of S3 and Gabe of Fuck yea Sei have all joined the show. Additionally, Layers hosted Nev, Glinch and of course Bic during the Crossover mint. \n\nThe creator fund will allow for the host of Layers, Grilled Onion, to obtain better equipment to improve the quality of the audio (no more twitter rugging) and also deploy an innovative viewing experience (going to try not to leak this plan but I'm pumped for it). \n\nTo date, Layers has been a 1 hour spaces, but after support received, the show is going to expand to a podcast that can be viewed on YouTube and Spotify for better distribution. We will also add more types of shows. ",

        "MRV → Regenerative Finance → Regenerative Design and Development\ndMeter is creating a decentralized monitoring, reporting and verification (dMRV) system. We are in the beginning of this dMRV process and countless building blocks are still missing. There will be problems and limitations that we encounter, but as these gradually get addressed it will become possible to use this new set of lego building blocks to build things that we can hardly imagine today.\nA. MRV (monitoring, reporting, and verification) overview\nMRV consists of three distinct features, all of which are vital to conveying legitimacy of regenerative projects (such as tree planting) to stakeholders. Monitoring is the process of measuring the total ecosystem and social services provided by the project. Measurements may be collected through satellite, IOT, georeferenced imagery from boots on the ground, as well as surveys that empower experts & citizen scientists. Reporting involves describing i) measured data, ii) the methodologies that were used to collect and analyze the data, and iii) potential biases as well as assumptions that went into the data collection/analysis. Verification refers to the review process involving a third party that is utilized to ensure the confidence in the validity of the uploaded data and methodologies.\nDecentralized measurement, reporting and verification (dMRV) means that no single entity will own, manage or regulate how MRV is done. Instead a collective of people from many different organizations can build upon and improve this dMRV system. For current accreditation standards a combination of on the ground data collection, satellite sensing and IOT devices are used to back the credits. Utilizing web3 mentality, trust minimized data collection methods can be created. An example of this is to write open codes for actions that used to be performed by humans, like detecting a tree and the species of tree it is. Other data collection technologies can become integrated into this system as they become standard in the future.\nOnce the data is collected, open source reporting and verification methodologies can be utilized to analyze the data. Entities that collect the data and create the analysis methodologies are paid each time data is used and an analysis done. This inspires entrepreneurs to build specialized dMRV services which can benefit further regenerative projects. The entire dMRV allows for standardization, trustlessness, immutability, transparency, and open accessibility. This paves the way for decentralized data backed credits. These credits are tied to a specific regenerative action and entity who carried out the action continuously updated over time as more data is gathered. This data and the methodologies used to analyze it is stored permanently and immutably. The collectors of this data are the owners of it, allowing for sensitive data to be fully controlled by its owner. The dMRV would assist regenerative projects across blockchains and be interoperable with any new blockchain that came into existence. Every entity that is involved with this dMRV helps to iteratively improve upon it. With this, local communities can become more deeply involved with how the regenerative projects they carry out go through the dMRV process as well as tap into funding that was not previously available to carry out these projects. Along with that the diversity and veracity of Natural Capital assets being valued can exponentially increase.\nMonitoring\nIn this dMRV everything is open to where there is only one final layer of trust- the data itself. Trust minimized data collection can be done through a combination of remote sensing, IoT, and human sensing (such as with smart-phones). The data collected is stored permanently and immutably through current technology such as Filecoin Green. By multiple data sources backing up that a regenerative action has occurred, more accurate calculations can be created. When one of those inputs is inaccurate, the other data sources can openly show a dispute. When a dispute arises, the stakeholders of the dMRV system can confirm or deny the accuracy of the data. Scoring this data for quality, resolution, and temporal frequency can enable any entity utilizing the dMRV to compare the data sources they pay for. Allowing them to quickly choose the best dataset for their needs. Through this, data becomes highly available as many organizations strive to provide the best data for people’s needs. This puts publishers on a level playing field and allows the companies with the best data to naturally succeed. Along with that publishers can not only benefit from the dMRV utilizing the data but other organizations that might want their data (such as parametric insurance). When individuals can decide who gets access to their data, they can ensure it is used ethically. They can also willingly give access to their data to those attempting to create good causes.\nReporting and Verification\nReporting and verification utilize algorithms. Algorithms are a set of instructions followed to solve a problem or accomplish a task (types of algorithms include standard, machine learning and AI). They are used to process data or information. For example georeferenced imagery can be analyzed using an algorithm that detects if a tree is present in that imagery. Another example is an algorithm can choose which data sources are the most appropriate for evaluating a regenerative action based upon how these data sources did previously. This is more efficient than a human could do, reducing the dMRV costs.\nPrevious MRV organizations have developed their own algorithms. Some of these algorithms are open source and will become part of the dMRV system if there is no conflict with the creators in doing so. Oftentimes it is only the MRV organization that developed the algorithm that uses it. Allowing more entities to utilize the MRV algorithm, “algorithms-as-a-service” (AaaS have arisen as a business model. AaaS allows entities of very small to large financial backing to benefit from them. For example, a small business might not have the resources to hire a data scientist to build and train a machine learning model or maintain the infrastructure needed to store the data that the model would be trained on. However, with AaaS, they can simply subscribe to a service and use the algorithms that have been created by someone else. Now through decentralization, algorithm providers can offer their services in a trust minimized and automated way. Along with that they can help financially support the providers of the data that was used to train that algorithm, which in turn gives data providers an incentive to provide high-quality and unique data that otherwise wouldn’t be available for training. Algorithmic transparency allows regenerative actions to demonstrate the ecosystem services they provide in a trustless, decentralized and immutable manner. Which in turn will attract more ReFi investors to support these actions. The more funding that gets channeled towards regenerative actions, the more the dMRV system is used and with each iteration it improves.\nInfrastructure\nIn order to host the data and distribute money to creators of algorithms, among other components of the dMRV system, decentralized infrastructure needs to be created. To permanently store the data collected, decentralized storage systems need to be utilized. For distributing that data to entities that would like to purchase it, data markets need to adequately display it. A new distributed system needs to be created for analyzing that data and paying for each time an analysis methodology is utilized. Some of these systems exist, however they can be improved upon to further support the dMRV system.\nDomain Experts\nFor each regenerative action type there are domain specialists. For example an ocean scientist is unlikely to know how to appropriately value tree planting, vice versa. In order to develop analysis algorithms appropriate to each regenerative action type, this specialized knowledge needs to be brought into the dMRV system.\nAs these domain experts are the ones likely to start creating tokens from the dMRV system (onboarding non web3 regenerative actions into this space) it is encouraged that a percent of their revenue goes towards supporting the dMRV system and if able provide grants for supporting the initial start of this. These organizations will not have control of the dMRV treasury.\nRevenue Sources\nThis dMRV system will be created bottom up from individuals and software, these individuals are who we aim to get rewarded through this software system. The flow of this system is planned to be as follows. An entity pays for collection of data, entities affiliated with this dMRV system collect the data using techniques that are part of this system. The data goes to decentralized storage which is paid for, then the entity that pays for the data is able to access it. The data is interpreted via methodologies either that the entity has proprietary control over or that is open source and part of the dMRV system. If the method is open source, a donation is channeled to the creators of the method for its use. The collected data is also marketed in a data marketplace, when people use the data they pay for the use of it. This payment goes towards both the marketplace and the data creator.\nSome of the business cases for dMRV are\ndMRV setup as a service\nRestoration project strategy for insurers\nEcosystem risk area assessment, regeneration plan, and MRV for insurers, municipalities, and eco-tourism enterprises\nEnvironmental Asset Creation- Carbon Credits\nHere are some empathy maps showcasing what each business case may be thinking- https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVP9wfNe8=/\nCross Organizational Support\nBehind all of this are people. These people have formed their own decentralized organizations specializing in different aspects of the dMRV system. There are organizations specializing in data collection, analysis and domain experts. The organizations participating in the dMRV will continue to expand as the system builds continued support.\nHere’s a complete map of the organizations that are part of dMeter: https://mm.tt/map/2252789449?t=NhUfVodAtw\nB. dMeter organizational structure\nThe Principles that dMeter Operates By Is:\nLegitimacy\nWe build with integrity, with high standards for quality of data and mindfulness with how it’s collected. We build legitimacy with the communities, stakeholders, and internal contributors involved by striving for alignment of our highest intentions with the day-to-day working processes that move our work forward.\nTransparency of Process\nWhen facilitating data collection, making decisions, or building tools, we provide clear documentation of how it was done, enabling people to understand what went into a specific action, decision, or strategy. In this process we aim to be as holistic as possible.\nCollaborative interoperability\nData infrastructure needs to be highly interoperable so individuals can take their data with them and use it in different ecosystems, technologies, and use-cases. We create space for collaboration between organizations and focus on the standards that enable interoperability for ecodata.\nDistributed & decentralized\nWe distribute and decentralize power. There is no top-down hierarchy in dMeter where you answer to a boss. We self-organize around our strategy and allow leadership to organically arise from the recognition of valuable contributions by the community. We hold ourselves accountable to dMeter as a community and dMRV as a movement, not any individual. Along with that we empower systems that enable anyone anywhere to collect and provide data to the system in a trust minimized way.\nClear Responsibility & Accountability\nWe take initiative to define our responsibilities given our role and desires in dMeter, and hold ourselves accountable to these responsibilities on a day-to-day basis. We support each other to take responsibility and accountability by doing it in our own workflow and communications.\nSome additional info for a deeper dive into dMeter’s strategy and operations can be found here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPLq3DtI=/?moveToWidget=3458764537112892386&cot=14\nWorking Groups\nWe’ve adopted working circles. These circles focus on unique aspects of dMeter and work closely together to move forward in sync. Moving forward, we are open to having sub-circles and other circles created as there is a need for more unique work streams that fold into the purpose of dMeter.\nDemand Sensing: Understand and develop relationships with users / customers of dMRV\nWhat we do:\nAnalyze the potential markets for holistic ecosystem data collection and engage the relevant customers to identify customer needs and opportunities to add value.\nUnderstand unique needs and forge relationships with key users and customers for the holistic data collection and analysis process.\nDefine the use cases that will shape the Engineering circle’s work on designing the data collection and analysis process.\nEngineering: Design and implement the ecosystem data collection and analysis process.\nWhat We Do:\nCo-create the process for setting up and engaging communities in ecosystem data collection with Demand Sensing\nDefine the process to decide on and implement the tech stack that’s needed for each unique data collection scenario\nCo-create and implement standards for storing ecological data with others working in the MRV space\nWork on the ground with pilot projects to install the technology and engage —— local stakeholders and independent operators\nGovernance and Operations: Steward the dMeter System;

Its goal is to broaden appreciation of, and access to, the beauty of mathematical ideas by producing content that, being conceptual, theoretical, philosophical, and historical, offers fresh and accessible presentations on the significance of the objects, theories, and questions that engross mathematicians today.\n\nGiven the sprawling scope and technical depth of many research programs in mathematics, extension of intelligibility to new communities requires novel labors to distill the crucial themes, conceptual overtones, findings, objectives, and stakes of contemporary mathematical research. Such labor can produce resources useful to math-adjacent communities, such as those of computer scientists, philosophers, physicists, and artists. \n",

In order to capture both LST and funding rate yields simultaneously, Cian will swap a portion of PYUSD to wstETH, and then use wstETH as collateral to provide funds on AAVE. To hedge against Eth price fluctuations, Cian will swap a portion of PYUSD to USDC and short the same amount of ETH on DYDX. In the future, Cian will launch a vault for GHO with the same mechanism as the PYUSD long-short strategy.",

        "The GLITCH art collective is organizing the fourth edition of its art residency. It’s a 3 weeks long event gathering blockchain / AI artists and engineers, collaborating on the creation of new NFT collections inspired by the notion of CC-0 and Remix. GLITCH is a unique opportunity to build new types of public goods, past editions have led to the creation of several protocols (e.g. REMIX NFT, IMPACT NFT) as well as an open source NFT Token-Bound Licensing standard to embed Creative Commons-like licensing conditions directly into NFTs.\n\nThis year, we will bring together a highly curated group of creative and smart individuals contributing towards or researching the use of blockchain and artificial intelligence in the artistic domain to produce new artworks, technical standards, philosophical concepts, research or products that tackle key societal issues. The underlying rationale of GLITCH is to push the boundaries of crypto art, i.e. to inspire artists and engineers to collaborate in order to explore the use of blockchain as a medium, rather than as a mere transaction layer.",

        'The Network of Trust is a blockchain-based skills graph for Token Engineering (TE) practitioners, serving as a decentralized accreditation alternative. The network will be co-created by TE practitioners, with value derived from the network graph as a whole and generated by applications incubated by commons investments. Stakeholders will benefit from commons ownership, with shared trust serving as a Common Pool Resource. \n\n## Project Goals\n\n1. Create a TE Skills Graph held by a commons, co-created by TE practitioners\n2. Develop a decentralized accreditation alternative for TE practitioners\n3. Build applications such as subject matter directories and marketplaces\n4. Increase visibility of TE and TE practitioners\n5. Establish public trust in TE as a public good\n\n## Work Done So Far\n\nOur team participated in a hackathon where we built a p2p network for ecological impact by combining attestations with the Ecological Benefits Framework (https://github.com/bhargavkakadiya/eth-denver-ebf). This experience demonstrated our ability to create attestation networks and deliver useful applications, as evidenced by our top 15 finish in the ETH Denver hackathon.\n\n## Outcome of Grant and Budget Allocation\n\nThe grant will enable us to deliver the following:\n\n- Proof of concept schema(s)\n- Public self-attestations\n- 2-3 Interest Groups or snowball cohorts\n- Limited number of attestees\n- PoC skills directory\n\nWith more funding, we aim to achieve:\n\n- More Interest Groups or snowball cohorts\n- Private, off-chain, base attestations\n- Public, composed, on-chain attestations\n- Peer-to-peer attestations\n- MVP Marketplace for Superchain\n- TE Audits and TE bounties\n\n## Contributors\nDarren Zal\nShawn Anderson\nBK\nDharmik Dholariya\nMonty Merlin\nScott Morris\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Token Engineering Network of Trust aims to advance the field of token engineering by creating a decentralized skills graph and accreditation system for TE practitioners. By fostering collaboration and nurturing the growth of trust in the network, this project will contribute to the growth and sustainability of the Token Engineering Commons. Our team\'s experience and expertise make us well-positioned to deliver on this vision and create a valuable "Commons Good" for the TEC.',

        'Fund research work for PDX DAO on Open Protocols of the City.\n\n**PDX DAO is looking for funding to support a research project on open protocols of the city.** \n\nTl;Dr: Our first eight months as a locally situated organization have opened our eyes to the symmetries and resonances between web3 protocols and the open social protocols that proliferate material and logistical knowledge sets in the city. We intend to research these open protocols in order to investigate and learn from these symmetries, the joint values for crypto and city communities they may gesture to, and the opportunity for selective implementation of web3 technology to aid the propagation of these permissionless and censorship resistant open knowledge sets.\n\n---\n\nPDX DAO has been engaged in an imaginative project since its conception, trying to understand what it means to translate web3 and Ethereum values - conceived in the context of the distributed web - to the city - local, geographically concentrated, and offline. \n\nOf course, the city is a furnace for decentralization in the sense of distributed *power.* While deals of extraction are made in (increasingly empty) office buildings, Starbucks and Target are forced out on the ground floor and a maker, artist, agricultural and organizational underground thrives, honing organically grown tools for fighting the metacrisis. \n\nWhen we approached this distributed power early on, we saw it through the lens of organizations, small businesses or nonprofits. But as we built out our urban network and our own sense of the value of web3 deepened, we began to think of it in a very different way, from the perspective of open protocols. \n\nIn their "The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols," Rao, Beiko, et al define protocols as “a stratum of codified behavior that allows for the construction or emergence of complex coordinated behaviors at adjacent loci.” Open social protocols are freely propagated codes for solving material and logistical problems outside of institutional permissions.\n\nPDX DAO is already familiar with the following open protocols being made use of in Portland: \n- mutual aid protocols\n- regenerative agriculture protocols\n- open hardware protocols\n- street medicine protocols\n- street art protocols\n- protocols of self-assembly\n- protocols of regulatory flight and civil disobedience\n\nIn all of these cases, a given organization may bear some responsibility for production or propagation of these codes, but the real action happens at the level of the distributed, shifting dynamic of the protocol. \n\nTo understand the successes of the city, it makes sense to consider the resonances and symmetries that exist between these open social protocols and the web protocols we are iterating on in the web3 space. \n\nIn fact, we think the web3 stake in the success and propagation of these open social protocols of the city is three fold: they represent not only a symmetry of structure and method (especially with regard to strategies of **permissionlessness** and **censorship resistance**), but an exemplification of the values of consent, voluntarism and freedom to exit as they enable an open, politically multivalent substrate of public goods. Finally, we believe that the success and viability of open protocols in scaling to address the needs of the climate crisis and replacing archaic institutions that generated it ultimately depends upon adoption of the web3 toolkit.\n\nThis is a hypothesis and research horizon, and there is work to be done to confirm and explore our intuitions. \n---\n\n**Questions we are asking**: What are the propagation structures of these open protocols? Do threshold shifts  (where significant and abrupt revisions are made to the protocol, as in protest protocols during the George Floyd protests) tend to be emergent, or generated from a central entity? Are protocol cultures in the city typically politically multivalent? \n\nHow can organizations like PDX DAO address and build relationships with these protocols, headless and leaderless as they are? What opportunities are there to promote permissionless and censorship resistance using web3 tooling? Are there pressure points where these tools may have asymmetrical benefit?\n\nHow can web3 tools be used to encourage open protocolization of heretofore closed knowledge sets? Are there opportunities for the use of tokens and augmented bonding curves to give organizations or companies with closed knowledge sets a mechanism to remain financially viable while opening and protocolizing their IP? Finally,  what are the implications of using web3 funding mechanisms to generate value flows centered around open protocols as non-institutional, commons pool resources?\n\nIf funded, this research project will result in a public study. Partners in this research initiative are welcome.\n',

Specifically because an individual or entity with an on-chain insurance policy can be come a target for bad actors.\n\n  \n\nFurther to this, traditional methods of verifying and validating consumer data often require the **disclosure of sensitive information, exposing customers and providers to potential privacy breaches and malicious actors.** This could impact consumers in both the process of acquiring a policy as well as making a claim.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, the web3 insurance sector struggles with complex and inefficient processes, which can lead to high costs and slow response times for customers. This is further exacerbated by the **lack of developer-friendly tools and frameworks for implementing privacy-preserving solutions in the industry,** limiting the adoption and understanding of ZK technology and its potential benefits.\n\n  ![Chamomile Logo](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SBHQgvsCjBe_b0Om8t7fygPUl9lbge-d)\n\n\n# What is our solution?\n\nChamomile aims to address these challenges by providing an **open-source toolkit and framework for designing, implementing, and managing privacy-preserving insurance policies using ZK proofs**.

        "> Human history is composed of significant historical events, and the past serves as a prelude. Today’s world has entered a turning point era once again. Global climate change, scientific and technological progress, and geopolitical influence are all happening at every moment, making the fate of human beings more closely linked together.\n>\n> What makes us curious is how to order such an entropy-increasing world, and the knowledge that these events contain in terms of time, causality, father-son, and correlation is an important resource for humanity. When we record it as it is, history is not a little girl to be dressed up. We do not want a centralized entity to control everything, making our history only opinions and no facts.\n>\n> Today, we begin anew, to build a history book written by the people and for the people.\n\n# UPTO3\nUPTO3 is an innovative **event knowledge graph protocol** designed to help users gain a deep understanding of and explore event data, and extract valuable information from it. It is based on the concept of an event knowledge graph, which constructs and utilizes event graphs to provide users with comprehensive and accurate event correlation information, thus supporting various intelligent applications and decision analysis.\n\n# Event Knowledge Graph\nIn the era of information explosion, people are faced with the challenge of dealing with massive amounts of event data. As an innovative data model, Event Knowledge Graph has become an important link connecting and sharing human events by organizing and representing events, entities, and relationships in a graphical form. It not only **helps us understand the correlations and influences between events**, but also **provides profound insights and decision support** support for decision-makers, scholars, and social researchers. However, building a comprehensive, accurate, and verifiable event knowledge graph has always been a huge challenge.\n\n![event knowledge graph](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*zzJPbX4M44YEGe9TpwL27Q.png)\n\n# Vision\nOur vision is to build a globally shared and verifiable human event knowledge graph by establishing a consensus-based blockchain protocol. We deeply understand the value and significance of event knowledge graph for human society, and therefore are dedicated to addressing the challenges of event extraction, verification, and correlation to provide a trusted event knowledge platform for the global community.\n\n\n## Components of the UPTO3 Protocol\n1. Event Elements\n2. Publisher Role\n3. Validator Role\n4. Event Validation\n5. Reward Mechanism\n\nFollowing the philosophy of Web3, UPTO3 builds **a decentralized and user-driven event knowledge graph platform. It realizes user participation and autonomy, protects data privacy, adopts open protocols and trustless interactions**, and reduces the involvement of intermediaries. \n\nBy combining artificial intelligence and blockchain-based technology, UPTO3 provides an innovative solution for constructing a reliable and high-quality event knowledge graph.\n\nYou can read more information [here](https://medium.com/@upto3/upto3-building-a-web3-protocol-for-human-event-knowledge-graphs-91da541e3cc0).\n",

        "I am Yash Jagtap, a Computer Science undergraduate from Pune University, and I'm thrilled to be volunteering at Devconnect in Istanbul. My journey in the world of technology and blockchain has been an exciting and fulfilling adventure, and I'd love to share a bit about myself and what motivates me.\n\nCurrently, I work as a Developer Relations Engineer at DataverseOS, where I get to be part of innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in the web3 space. One of my proudest achievements is the \"OneForAll\" project, where I've created boilerplate implementations for a wide range of web3 protocols. It's my way of simplifying the development process for others and contributing to the growth of the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nMy journey with blockchain and Ethereum has been ongoing for the past two years. I've delved deep into technologies like Solidity, React, JavaScript, and many others, honing my skills to create over 20 dapps. Contributing to open-source projects and building end-to-end web3 dapps is not just a passion but a way to give back to the community that has supported me throughout my journey.\n\nI'm also honoured to be the Lead of the Polygon Guild Pune, where I conduct workshops and meet-ups, sharing knowledge and helping others in their web3 endeavours. My contributions to the official Ethereum ecosystem on GitHub reflect my commitment to the growth and sustainability of this exciting technology.\n\nMy advocacy for web3 doesn't stop at my work. I've been deeply involved with Metaschool, a web3 ed-tech platform, where I managed a community of over 18,000 developers as a Developer Advocate until December. It's been an incredible opportunity to connect with and empower so many individuals in the space.\n\nI've also lent my skills and passion to organizations like LearnWeb3DAO, Buildspace, and The Graph, and I'm a proud Graph Advocate. Being a Postman Student Expert, I'm always eager to explore new technologies and share my knowledge with others. Open source development is close to my heart, as evidenced by my successful completion of Hacktoberfest 2022.\n\nWhat makes my journey even more fulfilling is my commitment to diversity and inclusion. I've taken part in teaching smart contract development to African women and non-binary individuals in association with Blu3DAO. Being an open-source repository maintainer of the 4C Community is another way I contribute to this thriving ecosystem.\n\nI was among the 1500 hackers selected for ETHIndia out of over 20,000 registrations, a testament to my technical expertise and dedication. Additionally, my role as an Ethereum Writers' Cohort participant has allowed me to embark on a blogging journey, sharing insights and knowledge with the blockchain community.\n\nI'm excited to share my experiences as a speaker at Web3Conf India, the biggest web3 conference in India, and at NEARAPAC 2023 in Vietnam. Representing The Graph India at the Hack4Bengal hackathon was a rewarding experience, as I conducted workshops and had the honour of judging projects created with the help of The Graph.\n\nRecently, I won the first prize of $7000 at the Chainlink Spring Hackathon 2023 among 498 other projects. This accomplishment has only fueled my enthusiasm for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the blockchain space.\n\nAs a volunteer at Devconnect in Istanbul, I'm eager to share my knowledge, experiences, and passion for the web3 world. My journey is a testament to the potential and power of blockchain and web3 technology, and I hope to inspire and empower others to join us in shaping the future of this incredible industry. Your support means the world to me, and I can't wait to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals at this exciting event.",

        "PolyCoach is a dApp built on Polygon that helps you use the 21-days rule to train good habits through Web3 style. We refer to the famous 21-day habit-building theory and practice it through smart contracts on the chain.\n\nYou can create an exclusive Coach on the Polygon mainnet to train a good habit by depositing a certain amount of tokens into the Coach contract and continuously withdrawing these tokens during 21 consecutive check-ins and earn $COACH token.\n\nThe current Web3 social products are too utilitarian, which makes most users use them for the potential wealth opportunities behind them. This further makes Web3 Social Dapp more financial. It is divorced from the communication and fun of social products. This makes the accumulated data useless and boring.\n\nWe believe that the mass adoption of Web3 social is based on the accumulation of real data from more real users. We are focusing on this, by exploring interesting online social scenes, so that more valuable data can be deposited in web3.\n\nTherefore, you will find that PolyCoach, a small toy with social interaction attributes and easy operation, will attract real users to use the product for non-utilitarian purposes. We will understand a user's life goals in a decentralized way, and obtain the progress of his efforts and other users' evaluations of him. PolyCoach is our first step. We will focus on allowing more and more dimensions of user data to be deposited in the Web3 environment and become the flywheel of Web3 Social.\n",

        '### TL;DR\n\nThis proposal outlines the second phase of the Trustful MVP, a Reputation Aggregator System. In this phase, we will aggregate onchain data to evaluate grants programs. After researching evaluation methods, we will collect and attest (through EAS) grantee opinions onchain, assigning reputations to these programs.\n\n---\n\n### **What are you building:**\n\nA Reputation Aggregator System designed to evaluate addresses (members, grants programs, DAOs, etc.). By aggregating onchain data such as past grantees, community support, defined milestones, detailed grant scopes, and contributions to the ecosystem, we aim to match high-quality grants with future builders. This will make resource allocation fairer and support data-driven decision-making for applicants.\n\n---\n\n### **Project Vision:**\n\nThe project is an experiment in the field of on-chain reputation and aims to address gaps still present in the ecosystem, such as Proof of Humanity, Verifiable Track Record of Past Contributions, and [**Valocracy.**](https://www.notion.so/f1ca6d59fad54ab9a8aa15924026a05f?pvs=21)\n\n*“Hence, “Valocracy”: A novel and structured social, economic, and political framework that attempts to leverage blockchain technology in order to create new forms of organizations with the goal of empowering communities along with their individuals and their combined efforts.”*\n\n---\n\n### Addressed problems\n\n1. **Verifiable track record of past: Fair Resource Allocation and Role Assignment**\n1.1 Lack of a Verifiable Track Record: Many grants distributed have funded unfinished projects or projects where the project creator vanished. This misallocation of resources not only wastes funding but also undermines the trust and effectiveness of the grant system. Ensuring that grants are directed towards projects with a proven track record of completion and sustained engagement is crucial for fostering a productive ecosystem.\n1.2 Arbitrariness in role selection decisions: Roles should be assigned to individuals with extensive knowledge and building experience in specific areas. Decisions should be based on verifiable reputation – contribution-based role assignment. This is also a factor in the selection of reviewers and enhances the support of these individuals leading the grants programs to the grantees.\n\n**2. Enhancing Grant Program Effectiveness Through Strategic Principles**\n\n2.1 Fair Resource Allocation: Ensure that resources are allocated based on the quality and potential impact of proposed projects, rather than solely on the amount requested or on who requested. This includes evaluating methodologies, the projected positive impact on relevant communities or sectors, and the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\n2.2 Quality of Impactful Projects: Emphasize projects that demonstrate innovation, technical feasibility, and strong execution capabilities. Evaluation metrics should include detailed work plans, strategic partnerships, and clear, measurable outcomes.\n\n2.3 Transparency and Accountability: Track if a Grant Program maintain a transparent and accountable selection process. This involves publicly disclosing evaluation criteria, engaging multiple stakeholders in decision-making, and implementing mechanisms for fund accountability.\n\n2.4 Promotion of Innovation and Collaboration: Encourage proposals that foster innovation within the ecosystem and promote collaboration among diverse stakeholders. This can be facilitated through thematic challenges, mentoring programs, or networking opportunities for grant recipients.\n\n**3.

        "Intro \nWelcome gang\nFightersgan is a 1/1 PFP collection that started in early 2022 when the founders looked for an alternative and more effective way to continue their fight against climate change and help Endangered animal species.\nWe believe Web3 is inevitable and an unstoppable force in the long run. Climate change is a global coordination problem and Climate change must be tackled and reversed Because, without a thriving physical world, there is no digital world. together we want to build a strong collaborative bridge between the digital & physical world\nWe believe that small actions can add up to make a big difference.\nWhy fighting climate change through Web3 and ReFi (Vision)\n- Supporting global solutions through local action by using Web3 tools like Dao \n- Making climate action accessible for more people. The smart contract tools inherent within Web3 technology could help to minimize layers of bureaucracy, so money flows more quickly and efficiently to people on the ground\n- Improving access to climate database by developing ecological state protocols through a collaborative process, and using open-source methodology, ReFi groups.\n- Redefining value: allows everyone to redefine value, connecting economic and ecological value. One of the primary ways that blockchain and Web3 can allow this is through the tokenization of ecosystems through nature-backed currencies.\n\n\n\nMission\nThe main goal behind the project is to be one of the collections with negative carbon emissions.\nThere are two ways to do this: 1- planting 100,000  Mangrove Trees ( have collaboration with Treegens byJimmi Cohen 2- education \nFor reforestation and tree planting we partnered with @foretreesclub to plant Mangrove Trees for 0.1 $ and will airdrop Carbon Credit to the future community.\n\nWhy mangrove trees: \n1-\tKeystone of a coastal ecosystem\n2-\tNursery grounds \n3-\tHome to many species\n4-\tFood for the multitudes\n5-\tA stable coastline \n6-\tClean water\n7-\t10X more efficient in any way.\n\n\nArt: \nArt is an inseparable part of NFT projects and in Fightersgang instead of using one character, four characters are used in the project, which are symbols of the most endangered animal species.\nPolar bear, cheetah, green turtle and Adelie penguin\nAlso, instead of using production NFT, the project is designed as 1/1.\nWhy 1/1 NFT:\n1- High rarity\n2- fairness For all\n\n",

        "Bluechip is an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to evaluating stablecoin safety and sharing our conclusions with the world at no cost. Our goal is to help every type of user make safer decisions, from people considering holding stablecoins for the first time, to regular users, to experts who manage large treasuries. \n\nThe need that Bluechip is trying to address is freely-accessible and credible information about the safety of stablecoins. Towards this objective, we developed an appropriate rating methodology that accounts for each stablecoin's constituent risks. The result of this effort is the SMIDGE rating framework: Stability, Management, Implementation, Decentralization, Governance, Externals. \n\nSMIDGE focuses on the fact that stablecoin projects are not to be trusted without solid evidence, and it pulls together the best available evidence on which project looks safer than others. We offer simple letter grades, more sophisticated graphics that sum up a stablecoin's strengths and weaknesses, and full reports that evaluate these and offer suggestions for improvement. \n\nOver the long run Bluechip aims to have important network effects, not just helping individual users make better choices, but also helping the entire stablecoin ecosystem become safer and more trustworthy, both by putting a spotlight on poor practices and by encouraging stablecoin projects to disclose more information about their liabilities, asset holdings, management quality, and governance systems.",

        "### Monthly Earth Day Phangan \n\n**Introduction**\n\nMonthly Earth Day is an initiative launched by [Highly Artistic](https://x.com/highlyartistic?s=21). It’s not just an annual event but a global movement that ignites action on the 22nd of every month. It's a call to individuals worldwide to step out and make a tangible impact on our planet. From opting for reusable bags to planting trees, every action, big or small, contributes to a collective effort to enhance our world. Participants share their contributions on X, showcasing the power of united actions in fostering positive change.\n\nIn just one year, the community has grown to include hundreds of individuals, businesses, and projects globally, making remarkable strides in environmental and social impact. Together, participants have planted over 30,000 trees and removed more than 2,000 pounds of trash from natural spaces. Our efforts extend to education on composting, sustainable living, and even rewarding contributors with tokens and crypto for their positive impact.\n\nRegen Phangan Community, including [ReFi Phangan](https://x.com/ReFiPhangan?s=21) and [Green Pill Phangan](https://x.com/GreenPillKPG?s=21) are happy to support Monthly Earth Day (MED)  every 22nd of each month. Our first initiative - monthly cleanup with main stage and decentralized points of action, where every individual can participate no matter where they are. \n\n![Image](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmXcjiexqmr66kFfSePnQnmDJhx2pj6qxjxjDiRPrRCS8v)\n\n### Grant Proposal\n\n**Objective:** MED Phangan seeks funding to support our environmental cleanup efforts. Our initiative aims to conduct monthly cleanups across the island, promoting ecological awareness and community engagement in environmental preservation.\n\n**Funding Needs:**\n\n1. **Materials:** Biodegradable bags and durable gloves for volunteers.\n2. **Logistics:** Rental of trucks for the transportation and proper disposal of collected waste.\n3. **Community Engagement:** Retroactive rewards and incentives for volunteers to boost participation and acknowledge their contributions.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n- **Environmental:** Reduce pollution and promote biodiversity on Phangan island.\n- **Social:** Foster a sense of community and environmental responsibility among participants.\n- **Education:** Increase awareness about waste management and environmental protection strategies.\n\n**Request:** We are seeking constant flow of income to fund monthly cleanups and reward the participation of volunteers. This investment in our environment will not only enhance the natural beauty of Phangan but also serve as a model for sustainable community engagement in environmental conservation efforts.\n\n**Conclusion:** With your support, we can continue to make significant strides in preserving the environment of Phangan. We believe that through collective action and dedicated funding, we can achieve a cleaner, greener future for our island and its inhabitants.\n",

        "Most attacks begin and end with the use of private services that allow funding or withdrawals without revealing the sender and recipient. \n\nThe most popular service among attackers of DeFi projects was the Tornado Cash mixer. However, after it was blocked by The US Department of Treasury, other projects will likely take over this niche. Aztec Protocol, which is a privacy-first zk-rollup on Ethereum, could be a potential such project. \n\nProject goal\n\nTo improve attack detection in the Forta Protocol ecosystem, develop two separate bots  to cover both the account funding stage before an attack and the money laundering stage that occurs after the attack is performed.\n\nFunded Account Interaction Bot\n\nThis bot detects when an account that was funded by Aztec Connect interacts with a contract.\n\nThe severity of these findings is low, as they do not indicate malicious activity. However, in the presence of other suspicious activity, they greatly increase the accuracy of attack detection.\n\nMoney Laundering Bot\n\nThis bot detects when numerous large transfers are made to Aztec Connect, potentially indicating post-hacking money laundering activity. All user transfers are summed up within a specified time and checked for exceeding the threshold. The severity of such findings is high.\n\nThese bots will work similarly to existing bots for Tornado Cash, and I'm sure they will be able to increase the accuracy as well as the number of detected attacks. \n\nAbout the Author\n\nI'm a Ukrainian developer, who has been developing bots for Forta Protocol since the beginning of the project. You may have seen me as a frequent contest winner as well as an active member of the community. At the moment I developed 19 bots, some of them are in the Forta Threat Detection Kit.",

        "# The emergence of Carbonvote 2.0\n\nCarbonvote.com's 2024 upgrade intends for it to be utilized in the Ethereum community, serving as a platform for gauging community sentiment on proposals related to the Ethereum network and as a tool that can be used for similar purposes in other community affairs. \n\nThis platform allows users to vote on issues offering a space for decentralized decision-making.\n\n## Background:\n\n[Carbonvote.com](https://beta.carbonvote.com) was a website built across several teams in the Ethereum Community. It facilitated a signaling mechanism for Ethereum stakeholders to express their preferences on important decisions. In the context of the DAO attack, it was used to conduct a carbon vote, a type of vote in which participants indicate their preferences by casting a certain amount of votes proportional to their stake in the network.\n\n[Carbonvote.com](https://beta.carbonvote.com) played a role in the aftermath of the 2016 Ethereum DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) attack. As a response to the attack, one proposed solution was a fork in the Ethereum blockchain, which would roll back the transactions associated with the DAO attack. This proposal led to a significant debate within the Ethereum community. (See [Repo](https://github.com/consenlabs/carbonvote))\n\nEthereum stakeholders were asked to vote on whether they supported the implementation of a hard fork to reverse the effects of the DAO attack. The carbon vote on carbonvote.com showed that a significant majority of the community supported the hard fork option.\n\nThe name “Carbonvote” is composed of two elements: “Carbon” and “vote”. In this context, “Carbon” symbolizes something fundamental and elemental. Just like Carbonvote is a fundamental governance tool in the Ethereum community it provides the functionality of poll voting and counting for big community decisions.\n\n## Objective & Carbonvote V2.0:\n\nThe DAO incident and the subsequent hard fork highlighted the challenges and complexities inherent in decentralized governance, with divergent perspectives within the community on how to address critical issues. For this upgrade, beta.carbonvote.com needs to address some known issues found in the previous implementation.\n\nAs the Ethereum community continues to evolve, there is a recognition of the need for improved signaling mechanisms and platforms like Carbonvote.com to facilitate community input on proposed upgrades and changes. The development of effective and inclusive tools for signaling and decision-making remains a priority for fostering consensus and maintaining the decentralized nature of the Ethereum network.\n\nTo address the goal of going beyond Zuzalu and creating advanced signaling tools for the Ethereum community, especially in the context of discussing potential hard forks, it’s important to consider the specific needs and concerns of core developers. The aim is to provide a platform that not only facilitates community input but also ensures the legitimacy of proposals, instilling confidence in core developers.\n\n## Key Features \n\nCarbonVote is a platform that enables the creation of polls, with real-time display of results. It supports two types of polls: EthHolding and HeadCounting.\n\n### A. Voting Methods:\n\n#### A.1 EthHolding Method:\n\n- Utilizes smart contracts for on-chain voting.\n- Dynamically calculates ETH held by each voting address.\n- Voters cast zero-valued ballots to specific addresses, determining Yes or No based on the transaction destination.\n- Real-time display of total ETH voted for each option during the voting process.\n\n#### A.2 HeadCounting Method:\n\n- Each voter's vote has equal weight.\n- Results displayed in real-time.\n- Introduces a Credentials system.\n\n### B. Current Features: Credential Checking System\n\n#### B.1 Credential Types:\n\n- Zupass Credential (Zuzalu Ticket Holders, Zuconnect Ticket Holders, Devconnect Ticket Holders):\n  - Requires holding specific Zupass tickets for voting.\n  - Integrates well with Zupass for authentication.\n- Gitcoin Passport Credential:\n  - Requires an authenticated Gitcoin passport with a score above zero for voting (test version).\n  - Allows customization of score thresholds in future releases.\n- Ethereum Events POAPS Credential:\n  - Requires a user's wallet to have a certain number of Ethereum events POAPS for voting.\n  - Verification methods include API and smart contract.\n- Protocol Guild Membership Credential:\n  - Corresponds to the HeadCounting method that each vote has the same weight.\n  - Requires the user's address to be on the list of protocol guild members, verified using a smart contract which is similar to EthHolding poll.\n\n### C. Upcoming Features:\n\n#### C.1 Usage of Secret Message:\n\n- Allows users to prove ownership of an account by sending a transaction with a locally-generated secret message, providing an optimized method for user verification.\n\n#### C.2 Changes in Storage:\n\n- Shifts all polls to Web 3.0 stacks, making polling data transparent and aligning with the vision of CarbonVote becoming a dApp.\n\n#### C.3 Poll Counting for Different Groups:\n\n- Allows polls to be open to multiple credential groups.\n- Counts votes of each group individually, providing a better reflection of diverse views.\n- Supports overlapping credentials within groups.\n\n#### C.4 Optimized Storage Methods:\n\n- Explores cost-effective ways of storing and deploying polls while preserving validation possibilities.\n- Considers methods such as off-chain signatures and storing on IPFS.\n\n## Build with us!\n\nExplore Carbonvote 2.0 - Now Open for Testing! 🚀\n\nWe're excited to announce that Carbonvote 2.0 is now open for testing! Dive into the beta version and experience the latest features at [beta.carbonvote.com](https://beta.carbonvote.com/). Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to enhance and refine the platform.\n\nJoin the Zuzalu Community Toolkit Server! 🏆\n\nFor collaborative discussions, insights, and the exchange of expertise, we invite you to join the Zuzalu Community Toolkit Server.

        "**Discord overwhelm is real.**\n\nYou can’t keep up. You speak into the void. It’s hard to participate. A Discord server is not a community.\n\nWe’re setting out to help people make meaningful connections in their communities and feel belonging through better-shared experiences. We give members easy and fun ways to participate.\n\nYour operators will now be able to design member experiences and get a real-time pulse on community engagement. Making participation tangible and fun. \n\n\n**Community is multiplayer.**\n\nPlaygotchi gamifies collective engagement where every member contributes to your community companion’s health. Community members get rewarded for their activity through playful interactions.\n\nMeasure what matters and get a tangible pulse on your growth and the relationships you’re building. Similar to quadratic funding: Instead of a small number of people doing the heavy lifting, you go farther when everyone collectively participates to keep the community thriving.\n\n![Playgotchi-Dashboard](https://images2.imgbox.com/c0/f3/wTQoDUzG_o.png)\n\n**Make the internet fun again.**\n\nBy assigning each community a unique virtual companion, Playgotchi helps you understand what meaningful involvement looks like week over week. Our main goal is to make measuring what matters a delightful experience anyone can do, and everyone is excited to take part in.\n\nThe health of the virtual companion corresponds with the overall health of the community. Community operators configure the engagement data they want to measure and track it through a real-time dashboard.\n\nThe platform encourages active participation as members' involvement, such as Discord posts and social media engagement, nurtures the community's virtual companion and rewards them with XP points. As the community prospers, members collectively achieve milestones, unlocking a variety of rewards that further enrich their experience.\n\nBy replacing traditional community metrics with this captivating, game-like model, Playgotchi fosters a sense of belonging and strengthens connections among members. The platform highlights the value of each contribution, ensuring that communities remain vibrant and engaged in a fun, interactive manner that traditional metrics simply cannot achieve.\n\n![Playgotchi-Game](https://images2.imgbox.com/78/4c/ubi02l0F_o.gif)\n\n**Help us hatch.**\n\nIn order to bring our MVP to life, we need your help.\n\nWe grew up in the era of Tamagotchi and Cool Math Games, exploring and learning via analog and early-digital experiences. We know how didactic experiences can help engage and capture people’s interest in a way no dashboard could.\n\nSo, now that we’re all grown up and looking to bring this sense of playfulness into our workspace. We gathered our inspiration from these experiences in a way that actually translates and gets the job done, no gimmicky virtual pets here. We’re using this interface as a vehicle for better connections among people.\n\nBy donating to this grant, you’ll be helping us experiment and see where this concept could lead us to. Specifically, we’ll be funding the following points for our first stages:\n\n* Launching a MVP to alpha test with at least one community.\n\n* Front and backend development\n\n* UX and UI design\n\n* Art and story\n\nWe’re excited to bring this idea to fruition and out in the open for people to play around with, we’re very open to hearing your feedback and cool ideas about how Playgotchi could fit your community’s need better!\n\n![Leapold-Dancing](https://images2.imgbox.com/b7/93/ytvLc54Q_o.gif)\n\n",

        "## About   \nAt Zuzalu, we believe in the power of open frontiers and decentralization to shape a future where every voice is heard, and every community thrives. Our journey continues with Zuzalu.city, providing an online space to build tools for Zuzalu software and empower communities.   \nAs we embark on this new journey, our primary goal is to cultivate a thriving community space that fosters collective collaboration. Zuzalu.city is more than a solution; it’s a catalyst for diverse initiatives and spin-off communities within and around Zuzalu.   \nTo achieve this, we are building open-source tools that empower everyone in our community. Coordinate builders in the community to build towards application experiences and tools both for/and independent of Zuzalu.city.   \n##    \n## Vision & Principles:   \nOur vision for Zuzalu software development is guided by five fundamental principles: Privacy, Ease-of-Use, Modularity, Composability, and Interoperability. These principles form the bedrock of our commitment to creating an online environment that is secure, user-friendly, flexible, customizable, and seamlessly interconnected.   \n### Definitions of principles:   \n- Privacy - Ensuring user data is private and in the control of users. Using privacy tech like ZKPs.   \n- Ease-of-Use - Focusing on spin-offs among other communities to be able to run their own sets of tools without deep technical knowledge.   \n- Modularity - Broken down independent modules and components each with their own attributes and functionality. This is to create more flexibility and be adapted to the needs of any given community.   \n- Composability - to be able to integrate a combination of various modules/primitives to create a customized, larger system.   \n- Interoperability - allows different systems or apps to interact and exchange data between them seamlessly.   \n   \n##    \n## Objective & Progress Update:   \n### Building Together:   \nZuzalu.city stands as a vibrant hub where collaboration thrives. Over 100 builders from various projects have joined forces, bringing their unique perspectives and skills to contribute to the Zuzalu ecosystem.   \nThe primary focus is to underscore interoperability between Zuzalu.city and various tools, ensuring seamless integration. A robust coordination process will be established, empowering community members to actively contribute and develop missing modules and components. This diverse group of contributors embodies the collaborative spirit that fuels our mission.   \n   \n*Invitations will be extended to [Element](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/[https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzME2L6mXR?i=d8D1Y90d](https://www.guilded.gg/r/zzME2L6mXR?i=d8D1Y90d)), enhancing community engagement with a focus on fostering meaningful and high-quality interactions.*   \n### Current List of Contributors   \n[Zuzalu Software Contributors](https://zu-builders.framer.website/),   \n###    \n### Progress Update:   \n- Zuzalu City is nearing its Alpha release, beginning with ZuVillage as the first community space and event in the app.    \n- Working with both Ceramic and OrbisDB teams, we've built much of the structure of the app on Ceramic. We are also making a shift to move from ComposeDB to OrbisDB for built-in functionality such as Gating and encryption via Lit Protocol.    \n- We have also built a full ticketing system working with Scroll team by designing and implement the smart contracts of scrollpass into the flow in addition to minting tickets for attendees. This will be launched soon after alpha is deployed.    \n- We are also working with other projects like LottoPGF, Blockful, streameth among a few others on testing their app directly on ZuCity and working towards integrating as an app within the structure of events and for community spaces. In addition to projects like Akasha + urbe.eth on decentralised social. View our list of integrations here: [https://zuzalu.craft.me/ZIzStdH9gNWmWI](https://zuzalu.craft.me/ZIzStdH9gNWmWI)   \n   \nLive DApp: [https://www.zuzalu.city/](https://www.zuzalu.city/)   \nTake a peek at the prototype (alpha): [https://alive-try-867960.framer.app/](https://alive-try-867960.framer.app/)    \n###    \n### Next Steps:   \nWe will continue building open-source tools for everyone to use. Coordinate builders in the community to build towards application experiences and tools both for and independent of the app. We also need to build a basis for an engineering environment to create a better process for a whole community of developers to contribute/co-build with us.   \n### More planned native features for an app experience:   \n- A social system with feeds, posts, etc.   \n- Improve event modules and implement additions i.e. side-events, ticketing, improve user experience.   \n- Expand on Community Spaces that can be customized with different native modules like events, messaging, and posts.   \n- Coordinate builders to hack features needed and integrate with exsiting projects to be in the Zuzalu Tech Stack.   \n   \n##    \n## Build with us!   \nWe eagerly await enthusiastic members to join forces with existing community builders, and contribute and take on challenges together. Here are at least three ways to get involved:   \n1. Co-build Shape the OS and build tools.   \n2. Module/Plug-in/Extension Integrate tools into the toolkit.   \n3. Requirements Providers (Feature R&D) Test Zuzalu infra with specific community experiences.   \n   \n*[Join Element ](https://matrix.to/#/%23zuzalusoftware:matrix.org)- contribute and participate in building Zuzalu Software*   \n[Join Zuzagora - for existing ZuPass holders](https://www.zuzagora.com/)   \n",

        "The current state of the web is centralized and controlled by a few large companies. These companies have a monopoly on our data and our identities. They can use our data to track us, target us with ads, and even sell our data to third parties. The current state of the web is not interoperable because user data remains in silos, we’re unable to share our data and interact with each other across different platforms.\n\nUS3R leverages the network effect, a principle that the team says is often exploited by applications such as Google and Facebook through user accounts or logins. These Web2 applications harness the network effect to attract users and extract value from their interactions.\n\nHowever, unlike these traditional models, US3R Network incorporates Web3 protocols, which offer users more control by virtue of their accounts being keypairs that the users themselves control. Despite the added control, Web3 protocols also necessitate a different infrastructure to support UI/UX at the protocol layer. This allows users to interact with the protocol via a universal third-party client, removing the reliance on the official dApps. The US3R Network fulfills this need for offchain data, taking inspiration from tools like Metamask and Etherscan.\n\nUS3R Network created U3, a platform-less utility tool designed specifically for managing self-sovereign data and applications. This opens up a new avenue of possibilities, allowing users to gain control over their data. Additionally, US3R Network offers S3, a development platform that enables developers to build dApps utilizing self-sovereign data. This combined suite of tools and platforms makes US3R Network an innovative solution for users and developers alike to gain control of their data and identities.\n\nUS3R Network is built on three core components:\n\nU3 is a decentralized identity wallet that allows users to store their data and credentials on the blockchain. U3 is interoperable with other blockchains, so users can take their data with them wherever they go. U3 is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses the EIP-4337 standard for decentralized identities.\nS3 is a decentralized data layer that makes it easy to share and manage data across different applications. S3 is built on Ceramic, a scalable and secure data storage platform.\n3R is a decentralized social layer that allows users to connect with friends and colleagues across different social networks. 3R is built on ActivityPub, an open protocol for federated social networking. ActivityPub allows users to own their data and control how it is shared.\nUS3R Network is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the web. By giving users control of their data and identities, US3R Network can make the web more interoperable, and user-centric.",

        'Our non-profit Aloha Earth is looking for donations to provide five separate large scale free water purifying stations across Maui, and three across Oahu.\n\nSince the Lahaina fires, many locals have gotten sick and have died from the toxic waters. Lahaina site construction workers are dying from the toxic water and air, and this issue has been swept under the rug and dearly urgent. We remove heavy metals, chemicals, and hormones and need funding to bring these water and air purification stations up ASAP to help the local communities.\n\nWe are partnering with Haven water for the units and are getting them at manufacturing cost. Haven\'s founder, Daryl "Ida" Kemsley, is also a for purpose film maker, and is currently creating a documentary, Aloha Always Wins, focusing on the sustainability of indigenous living, and providing a reference point to western audiences on how to thrive through disasters, and live in Aloha, community spirit in sustainable ways.\n\nOur funding goes to our Land preservation projects (5acres in Lahaina), Land rehab (Non profit Aloha Organics which turns toxic lands clear for farming again), Food (micro and macro) delivering 1800 meals a week with Hungry Heroes Hawaii, and setting up seminars and giving free Poi boards to help Hawaiians go back to their food sovereignty with the re-introduction of Poi making (their sacred food). We are giving away free Poi boards to every local family and providing seminars where they may learn to make poi from Taro, the number 1 underutilized starch according to the UN. And lastly, purified water. The water has become toxic and through working with Haven, we are bringing 8 major free filtered water stations, and looking to provide 50 free home filtrations to families directly affected by the fires.\n\nAny donations and sharing helps, may reach out on how to officially be a producer on our film, which will be launching with a platform for service project follow ups and non profit merchandise to support.\n\nIf you would like full producer deck of our for purpose film aimed for multi-generational impact, you may email me at ida@havenwater.io\n\nMuch aloha, thank you!',
